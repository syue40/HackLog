# HackLog
A collection of programs I'm working on in Python.

This is an ongoing project I'm using to learn about how python programs can be written to attack other computers.

#To Do:
- add email capability to Keylogger. This would send an email from host computer to any email address using SMTP.
- update Trojan horse with additional scripts that can be run on host computer
- Other ideas loading...
